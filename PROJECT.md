Build me an interactive 3D Art museum of Art history that runs in a browser.



## THE TIMELINE

The entry point is a zoomable, infinite-canvas timeline of art history -- node based, organized by real dates. Zoomed out, I see the full sweep of art history's periods -- comprehensive, not just a famous few: Medieval and Gothic through Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neo-classism, Romanticism, Realism, Impressionism, post-impressionism, Expressionism, cubism, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, pop art, up through Contemporary. Zooming into a period surfaces Caravaggio. Clicking an artist opens a card about them: design this card with a timeless, museum-placard quality -- portrait, dates, a few lines on who they were and why that mattered. The timeline is also filterable by  period and by artist - and the filter itself should be an interactive, beautiful moment with smooth GSAP-quality animation, in dropdown that swaps contents.

## THE MUSEUM

From an artist's card, I enter that artist's own 3D museum - a first-person walkable gallery (WASD+mouse) hung with their real paintings. Clicking any painting opens an inspect view: a zoomed, high-resolution look with the title, year, the story behind the piece, and fun facts.

## DATA  - ALL FROM WIKIPEDIA

Every artist bio, painting image, date, story, and fun fact is pulled from Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons (public-domain images). Do not generate any artwork of fact with AI -- if it isn't on wikipedia, it doesn't go in. The timeline must cover at least 12 periods comprehensively, with 3+ artists per period and 8+ paintings per artist museum. Store all of it in a Neon Postgres database whose connection string is in .env.local - never print or display the connection string.

## VISUAL QUALITY

This cannot look like a lazy Three.js demo. Make the galleries as realistic as possible: physically-based materials, realistic lightening with individual spotligach painting, soft shadows, subtle glare on the frames, reflective floors, proper tone mapping. Treat the lightening and shadows as seriously as the layout -- The realism is the point.



## CHECKS-IN

Check in with me at key decision points instead of deciding silently. Specifically: 

1. Before building the timeline, present 3 design directions for the timeline view, labeled A/B/C with a one-line tradeoff each, and wait for my pick.
2. Check in on the artist-card design before applying it everywhere.
3. Check in on the interaction for entering an artist's museum from the timeline, and on the click-to-inspect interaction for paintings.

Keep each check in short.

Deploy live Vercel, then QA the deployed site with Playwright before calling it done. The whole interaction should be smooth, reactive, elegant, fun and with a lot to learn for curious enthousiasts!
